## Description
The webapp contains allows one to search for User profiles and Repositories from Github as well as view info associated to each.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
The github page is currently live thus the following link will take you to the webpage "https://swanapole.github.io/git-search/" As long as you have a compatible browser the document will work. Internet Connection is required to initiate API connection

## Known Bugs
Not seen any but the user is welcome to identify any

## Behaviour Driven Development
The program should return a user's profile details when the correct username is entered in the User Profile section.

The program should return repositories in relation to the search term the user enters in the Repositories section.

When the user clicks on the repository link it should redirect them to the github site for that repository.

When the user clicks on 'Visit Github Site' on a user's profile they should be redirected to the user's github site.

## Technologies Used
HTML was used in making the skeleton of the website.

CSS and Bootstrap was used in styling the document.

Atom was the source code editor of choice.

Git and Github were used as my local and online repositories respectively.

AngularCLI was used in creating the components/classes/directives/pipes needed in the web-app

Github's API and Access Token was used in creating the connection to Github.
